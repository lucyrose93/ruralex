                            The river is often described as “natural” or “wild”, yet what we encounter along
                            its banks are sluice gates, flood defences, pumping stations and bridges. These
                            structures shape how water moves and how people live with it, but they are
                            usually perceived as background.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this field visit we experimented with listening walks as a way of making
                            these backgrounds more tangible. Rather than searching for idyllic “nature
                            sounds”, we paid attention to mechanical rhythms, echoes under bridges, and the
                            distant roar of trucks on the ring road.

                            “Listening became a way of staying with the tension between river as landscape
                            and river as infrastructure.”

                            We met residents who spoke about flood memories, anglers negotiating restricted
                            zones, and seasonal workers who use the riverside path to reach temporary
                            housing. Their stories complicate the neat distinction between “rural” and
                            “urban” by showing how the river is tied into wider logistical networks.

                            These questions will continue to guide our work in the valley. Audio excerpts
                            from the walk, together with maps and transcripts, will be added to the case

    <h1>RURALEX: Knowledge in Crisis</h1>
    <h2>The dynamics of evironmental expertise amidst rural change</h2>

    <p>RURALEX is a three-year research project that studies the cumulative crisis of environmental expertise across Europe’s rural areas. Funded by HERA-CHANSE, we are a team of 17 researchers investigating how shifts in people’s knowledge about the environment shape social, cultural, and ecological challenges facing local communities today.</p>
    <p>Across Europe, rural regions are undergoing major transformations. Population decline, urban migration, and the loss of traditional agricultural practices have disrupted long-standing relationships between people and their environments. This is leading to many forms of ecological know-how transforming, fading, and being generated. Our research spans diverse sites, from the Spanish Pyrenees to southeastern England, from the Bulgarian Danube basin to the northern cost of Norway. Using long-term ethnographic and archival methods, we document how environmental knowledge evolves across generations and landscapes. We also develop innovative tools to capture stories, sounds, and images that reflect how people relate to their environments. We hope to show how better understanding local knowledge can help address Europe’s pressing ecological and social challenges — and why the humanities are essential to understanding our shared future.

    <p>Old paths in the soil,<br>
        knowledge drifting with the wind<br>
        crises call, listen<br></p>
    <p>Where authority<br>
        once grew from hands in the earth,<br>
        data feels lonely.</p>
    <p>Methods dance in turn:<br>
        sound, map, archive, fieldnotes<br>
        we gather the threads.</p>
    <p>If this stirs your mind,<br>
        or tempts a mischievous thought<br>
